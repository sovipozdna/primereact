## What are the main features of Traktor Pro 2?
     
Traktor Pro 2 has many features that can help you create amazing mixes and remixes. Some of the main features are:

- **Sample Decks:** You can switch any deck to a Sample Deck and load up to four loops or one-shot samples each, or 16 in total. You can use the samples to add extra sounds, vocals, or effects to your mix. You can also sync the samples with the tempo of your tracks.
- **Loop Recorder:** You can record loops from mixer channels, master out, or audio interface inputs, while you mix. You can then drag and drop the loops to the Sample Decks or Remix Decks to use them in your mix.
- **Remix Decks:** You can use the Remix Decks to remix your tracks on the fly. You can load up to 64 loops or samples per Remix Deck and trigger them with your mouse, keyboard, or controller. You can also adjust the volume, filter, pitch, and effects of each sample.
- **Effects:** You can apply over 30 effects to your tracks, such as reverb, delay, flanger, distortion, and more. You can also chain up to four effects per deck and tweak them with the knobs and buttons on your controller.
- **Sync:** You can sync the tempo and phase of your tracks automatically or manually. You can also use the Sync Lock feature to keep your tracks in sync even if you change the tempo or pitch.
- **Cue Points:** You can set up to eight cue points per track and jump to them with a click or a button press. You can also use the Hotcues feature to create live edits of your tracks.
- **Flux Mode:** You can use the Flux Mode to scratch, backspin, or chop your tracks without losing your position in the track. The track will continue playing in the background and resume from where you left off when you release the jog wheel or platter.
- **Mixer:** You can adjust the sound of your mix with EQs and a filter on each channel. You can also use the crossfader to blend between two tracks or use the fader start feature to start playing a track when you move the fader.
- **Mix Recorder:** You can record your mix and save it with a tap using the built-in Mix Recorder. You can also export your mix as an audio file or upload it directly to SoundCloud or Mixcloud.
